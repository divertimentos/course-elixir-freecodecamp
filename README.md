# What does "Functional Programming" mean?

- It means that the program is composed of differentet functions
- There is no classes or objects
- All data type is immutable/constant. Since the data isn't mutable, the state remains the same. The data can be distributed more easily. It's scalable.
- We do not have `for` loops. We loop through collections using `map`, which takes a collection and applies transformations to all of its elements and then returns a **new** collection as a result.
- Elixir uses recursion

# What is Recursion?

And why it's important?

Recursion is doing the same task again and again. The task calls itself, so it runs again, and again.

# Un-learning

_(aka all that you know versus all that you don't)_

The `a = 1` concept isn't an assignment, it's literally the mathematical **equal**. It means that `1 = a` is the same. It's a **match** operator. That's Pattern Matching.

# Pattern Matching

`[a, a] = [1, 1]`

All data assignments in Elixir are immutable. Immutability is important for scalability.

Elixir lets you do the following:
`a = 1` and then
`a = 2`

And to be honest I still don't understand why. But to avoid that, you can use the Pin Operator:

`^a = 3`.

The teacher said that these things should be more clear in the future, as we see more examples. Immutability is important to transfer data to other places without needlessly using extra resources.

# Actor Model

All code is executed within this thing called Actor. It receives messages that could be data or instructions. It process messages and returns responses. It gets, processes, and gives data back in return.

## Processes

Data can distributed among clusters of machines, horizontally. That can happen across the globe by using threads.

Actors run in processes and have an unique PID. We can communicate with these processes by message-passing. Since the data is immutable, we can create copies that can be sent to different processes. We don't need to worry if that information is transformed inside a given process; everything is done in isolation.

Each process has its own Stack and Heap allocation. Ok **NOW** I couldn't get. I know these words are in the bible, but I remember what they mean.

## Working

- Every process has its own Mailbox that receives messages
- It works independently
- It works FIFO
- It's cheap to create processes
- They communicate via message-passing

To address which PID a process is using, you can call the `self()` function.

```elixir
> IO.puts(self())

> ** (Protocol.UndefinedError) protocol String.Chars not implemented for #PID<0.98.0> of type PID
    (elixir 1.16.1) lib/string/chars.ex:3: String.Chars.impl_for!/1
    (elixir 1.16.1) lib/string/chars.ex:22: String.Chars.to_string/1
    (elixir 1.16.1) lib/io.ex:784: IO.puts/2
    process.exs:1: (file)
```

# Finally, the Hello World!

- `.exs` files are used to create scripts. So the `s` stands for "Script"
- `ex` are compile files

All Elixir code stay inside a module. Module names and file name should be the same.

We can run code using `elixir hello.exs` to run the file. For the function to return you'll have to call it, like `Hello.world()` at some point in the file.

We can also compile the `.exs` file by using `elixirc hello.exs`. Now you don't need to call the functiona explicitly.

There's a third way to run the code, which is compiling it inside the `iex`. Enter the `iex` shell and type `c filename.exs`.

Ok, there's a fourth way. Inside the `iex` you can call the module followed by the function using dot notation:

- `Hello.world()`
  It will show an atom. In this case it shows `:ok`.

To recompile an already compiled module (which process is saved in memory and needs to be re-compiled), you can use `r`. Like `r Hello.

# Data Types in Elixir

All data types are constants, because all data is immutable

## Atom

Their syntax is `:atom_name` or `:"Atom name"`.

An atom is the representation of the combination of a variable and its data. For example, the pseudo-code `var nike = "nike"` can be represented by `:nike`. They're useful for pattern matching.

An example is

```elixir
{:error, reason} = {:error, "file not found"}
IO.puts(reason)
```

## String

Represent by double quotes. If you use single quotes they are character lists, which is different from a string. Elixir uses UTF-8. Inside the `iex` you can use `i("Your string")` to check extra informations about them:

```elixir
Interactive Elixir (1.16.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)> i("My string")
Term
  "My string"
Data type
  BitString
Byte size
  9
Description
  This is a string: a UTF-8 encoded binary. It's printed surrounded by
  "double quotes" because all UTF-8 encoded code points in it are printable.
Raw representation
  <<77, 121, 32, 115, 116, 114, 105, 110, 103>>
Reference modules
  String, :binary
Implemented protocols
  Collectable, IEx.Info, Inspect, List.Chars, String.Chars
iex(2)>
```

The `<>` is the String Concatenation Operator. This is what it can do:
`"O" <> rest = "Octavarium"` . The result is `ctavarium`. What happened is "O" is matched/attributed to "O", and the remainder of the characters are now equal to `rest`.

To access the Raw representation of a char, open `iex` and type `?a` for example.

- `?a` equals to `97`
- `?b` equals to `98`
- `?c` equals to `99`

## Charlist

Charlists are lists. To concatenate them, instead of `<>` we're using `++`.

```elixir
chars = "Octavarium"
IO.puts(~c"Hello, " ++ chars)
```

You can test if something is a list using `is_list()` function. Since everything is a function, I'll stop using "xyz function", because... yeah.

## Processes

To check the process, just use `self()`. They're unique.

## Lists

Lists are linked lists. That means that indexing doesn't work.

- `IO.puts(list[0]) # <- it doesn't work.`

Linked lists are recursive. We handle them using recursion and built-in modules. Like `Enum`. To show the functions provided by a built-in module, open `iex` , start typing `Enum.`, and then hit Tab.

![enum builtins](https://github.com/divertimentos/course-elixir-freecodecamp/blob/main/assets/enum-functions.png)

## Function Arity

The numbers at the right of each `/` represent the number of parameters the functions expects. Some can have multiple expectations, like `any?/1` and `any?/2`. As far as I understood, they can be optional parameters. We call it Arity.

## Seeking help from documentation (Function Definition)

- Open `iex` and type `h(Enum.at)` to open `Enum.at` documentation. Pretty neat!

### Extracting data from lists using pattern matching

```elixir
lista = ["a", "b", "c"]

[first, second, third] = lista
```

Elixir compiler will curse if you let an extracted/destrucutred variable unused. To ignore some some items from the list, use underscored (`_`).

### Convenience list functions

```elixir
listb = ["a", "b", "c"]

hd(listb) #returns the first item

tl(listb) # returns the remaining items

```

### Cons operator

The Cons separates the head from the remainder of the items

```elixir
listc = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]

[h | t] = listc
```

## Tuples

Tuples are defined using curly brackets (`{}`), so **THAT'S** a big difference between Elixir and JavaScript. Let's see tuples' properties. Tuples as indicated to store a small collection of entities, since they are similar to arrays.

It's commont to have tuples that have just two or three elements. But why?

It's possible to pattern match them as well. When using Phoenix frameworks, it's common to see tuples like this one:

`{:reply, msg, state} = {:reply, "Octavarium found!", ["Ocvatarium", "Louise", "ChicÃ³"]}`

I just didn't understand why tuples are useful. I mean, in Python they are the same as sets, so they are useful for what sets are useful, mathematically. They store unique, values that can be addressed by their index. Are Elixir tuples similar? The teacher didn't explain.

## Keyword Lists

They are key/value-paired lists. But each element inside it is actually a tuple. Ok, now tuples are getting interesting. To retrieve elements from it, it's similar to lists:

```elixir
data = [a: 1, b: 2]
IO.puts(data[:a])
```

## Maps

To create a map, use curly bracked preceeded by a percent symbol: `%{}`. They are similar do Python's dictionaries (or JavaScript objects). They offer more features than Keyword Lists and Tuples.

- Example of map: `my_map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}`
- Example of a map which keys are strings: `my_map2 = %{"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}`

To access regular maps, you can use pattern matching, and dot notation.

- Pattern matching: `%{a: first, b: second, c: third} = my_map`
- Dot notation: `my_map.a`

To access maps which keys are strings, use arrows too:

- Arrows: `%{"c" => c} = my_map2`

### Updating values inside a map:

```elixir
my_map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
my_map = %{my_map | c: 4}

my_map2 = %{"a" => 1, "b" => 2, "c" => 3}
my_map2 = %{my_map2 | "c" => 4}
```

Ok, I think I understood what just happened. Before the pipe ("`|`") operator is the "head", meaning that you're appending "`'c' => 4`" to whatever that matches its key. Thinking again, the head doesn't matter because you could be replacing/updating the first/head element too. The Pattern Matching is what matters here.

Ok, Pattern Matching is a really important feature to Elixir.
